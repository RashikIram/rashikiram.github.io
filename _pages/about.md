## Hi, I'm Rashik Iram Chowdhury

I'm a Computer Science graduate from North South University and currently an **Adjunct Lecturer** at Southeast University, Dhaka, where I teach core undergraduate computer science courses to over **180 students**. My research lies at the intersection of **multi-modal learning**, **medical image analysis**, and **edge intelligence**, with a focus on building **lightweight and explainable AI systems** that are deployable in real-world, resource-constrained environments. Much of my recent work is applied to **assistive technology**, particularly AI-driven navigation for the visually impaired and mobile diagnostic tools in healthcare.

I'm currently expanding my research into **causal inference**, **open-world object detection**, and **long-tailed classification** — with the goal of designing AI systems that generalize beyond curated datasets and adapt to the complexity of real-world environments.
