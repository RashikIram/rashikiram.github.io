<h2 class="exp-heading">About Me</h2>
<div class="exp-card">
<p>
I am a Computer Science graduate from North South University and currently an Adjunct Lecturer at Southeast University, Dhaka, where I teach core undergraduate computer science courses to over 280 students. My research lies at the intersection of multi-modal learning, machine learning applications, and edge intelligence, with a focus on building lightweight and explainable AI systems that are deployable in real-world, resource-constrained environments. Much of my recent work is applied to assistive technology, particularly AI-driven navigation for the visually impaired and mobile diagnostic tools in healthcare.
</p>

<p>
I am currently expanding my research into causal inference, open-world object detection, and long-tailed classification, with the goal of designing AI systems that are trustworthy and generalize beyond curated datasets, adapting to the complexity of real-world environments.
