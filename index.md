<h2 class="exp-heading">About Me</h2>
<div class="exp-card">
<p>
I'm a Computer Science graduate from North South University and currently an <strong>Adjunct Lecturer</strong> at Southeast University, Dhaka, where I teach core undergraduate computer science courses to over <strong>180 students</strong>. My research lies at the intersection of <strong>multi-modal learning</strong>, <strong>medical image analysis</strong>, and <strong>edge intelligence</strong>, with a focus on building <strong>lightweight and explainable AI systems</strong> that are deployable in real-world, resource-constrained environments. Much of my recent work is applied to <strong>assistive technology</strong>, particularly AI-driven navigation for the visually impaired and mobile diagnostic tools in healthcare.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently expanding my research into <strong>causal inference</strong>, <strong>open-world object detection</strong>, and <strong>long-tailed classification</strong> — with the goal of designing AI systems that generalize beyond curated datasets and adapt to the complexity of real-world environments.
